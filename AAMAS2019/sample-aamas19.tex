\begin{abstract}  % put your abstract here!
In the literature, there are many works on task assignment in crowdsoucing system. However, most existing works in crowdsourcing haven't taken binding constraint of tasks into account, and do little research on truthful mechanism. In this paper, we consider a simple task assignment scenario, where the tasks with binding constraint have existed in a crowdsourcing platform, and tasks is announces by requester who just ask for single skill, self-interested workers that don't discriminate binding constraint and has demand constraint. As there is a binding constraint between tasks, we call problem as binding task assignment problem (BTAP). We focus on solving BTAP to achieve minimization of total cost of workers and using proper approach to guarantee truthfulness of the workers. We convert homogenous tasks with binding constraint into heterogeneous tasks with different attributes. We apply VCG-based reverse combinatorial auction to solve BTAP, and our approach to achieve good property, including incentive compatibility and individual rationality, budget balance. In our experiment, we evaluate the performance of our approach under different simulation settings.
